Neo4j extracts CDC information from the transaction log.
However, by default the transaction log does not contain information directly usable by CDC.
For CDC to work, the transaction log need to be _enriched_ with further information.
This is applied as an extra configuration option to each database.
As soon as CDC is enabled, the database is ready to answer CDC queries from xref:examples/index.adoc[client applications].

CDC has three _enrichment modes_:

- `OFF` -- CDC is disabled (default).
- `DIFF` -- Changes are captured as the difference between before and after states of each changed entity (i.e. they only contain removals, updates and additions).
- `FULL` -- Changes are recorded as a complete copy of the before and after states of each changed entity (i.e. the contain the full node/relationship, regardless of the extent to which they were altered).
