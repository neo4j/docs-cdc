= Use CDC to query changes (procedures)
:description: This chapter describes change data capture procedures.

Once CDC is enabled, there are a number of Cypher procedures that you may use to query changes.

CDC works with _change identifiers_, which are essentially pointers to specific transactions.
The CDC procedures allow you to retrieve specific change identifiers or to query for changes that affected the database _after_ a given change identifier.

[TIP]
====
**Change identifiers are local to the database they are generated for**, and cannot be used to query changes on another database.
Keep this in mind when restoring a database from a backup, since the restored database is practically a new database.
See xref:backup-restore.adoc[restore from backup] for details.

[[earliest]]
== Retrieve the earliest change identifier

The procedure `db.cdc.earliest` returns the change identifier for the earliest available change.

.Query earliest change identifier
====
.Query
[source, cypher, test-exclude-cols=id]
----
CALL db.cdc.earliest()

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="1*<m"]

| +id+
| +"A3V16ZaLlUmnipHLFkWrlA0AAAAAAAAABQAAAAAAAAAA"+
|===

====


[[current]]
== Retrieve the current change identifier

The procedure `db.cdc.current` returns the change identifier for the last committed transaction.

Note that **the returned identifier is exclusive**: it does not include the changes that happened in the transaction it points to.

.Query current change identifier
====

[[query]]
== Query changes

The procedure `db.cdc.query` returns the changes that happened to the database _after_ the given change identifier.

[source, syntax]
----
db.cdc.query(
    from =  :: STRING?, // <1>
    selectors = [] :: LIST? OF MAP? // <2>
) :: (
    id :: STRING?, // <3>
    txId :: INTEGER?, // <4>
    seq :: INTEGER?, // <5>
    metadata :: MAP?, // <6>
    event :: MAP? // <7>
)
----

<1> The change identifier to query changes from, either captured from an earlier call to `db.cdc.query` or from one of xref:#current[`db.cdc.current`] or xref:#earliest[`db.cdc.earliest`].
The default value is `""` (empty string) which is replaced with `db.cdc.current` implicitly.
**This value is treated as exclusive**, so the results of the query do not include the changes that happened on the transaction corresponding to this change identifier.
<2> An optional list of xref:procedures/selectors.adoc[selectors] to filter out changes.
The default is an empty list, which means _all_ changes are returned, without any filtering.
<3> The unique change identifier associated with each change record.
Each of these can be used for further `db.cdc.query` calls.
<4> A number identifying which transaction the change happened in, unique in combination with `seq`.
Transaction identifiers are not continuous (some transactions, such as system and schema commands, are not recorded in change data capture and cause gaps in the transaction identifiers).
<5> A number used for ordering changes that happened in the same transaction.
Note that the order of changes observed in the output does not necessarily correspond to the order in which changes were applied during the transaction.
<6> A map of values containing transaction metadata.
This is the same for all of the changes in a single transaction.
For a detailed description of the metadata fields, see xref:procedures/output-schema.adoc[].
<7> The retrieved changes on the affected entity.
For a detailed description of the change event, see xref:procedures/output-schema.adoc[].

[[earliest-change-event]]
== Retrieve the earliest change event

The procedure `db.cdc.earliest` returns the change _identifier_ for the earliest available change, but not the associated change _event_ information.
To retrieve the earliest change event, you can feed the earliest change ID into `db.cdc.query` and limit the result to one.
Change events are already sorted chronologically so no sorting is needed.

[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.earliest() YIELD id AS earliestId
CALL db.cdc.query(earliestId) YIELD event, metadata
RETURN event, metadata LIMIT 1
----


[[latest-change-event]]
== Retrieve the most recent change event

To retrieve the most recent change event, you can feed the earliest change ID into `db.cdc.query`, reverse-sort them, and limit the result to one.
This query can be very slow, as it needs to scan through all change events before.

[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.earliest() YIELD id AS earliestId
CALL db.cdc.query(earliestId) YIELD event, metadata
RETURN event, metadata ORDER BY metadata.txCommitTime DESC LIMIT 1
----


== A minimal working example

The easiest way **to see CDC in action** is by xref:#current[retrieving the current change identifier], creating a new node in the database, and then xref:#query[querying for changes] using the previous change identifier.
The operations must happen in three separate transactions.

.Transaction 1 -- Retrieve current change ID
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.current() YIELD id AS currentId
// currentId = 'BaQswf9NV0b7qicwDdh7vfwAAAAAAAAD83__________AAABjzfm4bM'
----

.Transaction 2 -- Create new `Person` node
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (:Person:Hero {name: 'Batman', color: 'black'})
----

.Transaction 3 -- Retrieve change event for `Person` node creation
[source, cypher, test-result-skip]
----
WITH 'BaQswf9NV0b7qicwDdh7vfwAAAAAAAAD83__________AAABjzfm4bM=' AS previousId
CALL db.cdc.query(previousId) YIELD event, metadata RETURN event, metadata
----

.Result
[role="queryresult",options="header,footer",cols="a,a"]
|===
