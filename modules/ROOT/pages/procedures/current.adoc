= Acquiring the current change identifier

The procedure `db.cdc.current` is used to acquire a change identifier for the last committed transaction.
Note that the returned identifier is exclusive, and does not include the changes that happened in the transaction it points to.

.Signature
[source]
----
db.cdc.current() :: (
    id :: STRING? // <1>
)
----

<1> A change identifier that refers to the last committed transaction.

[WARNING]
====
Change identifiers are local to the database they are generated for, and cannot be used to query changes on another database.
You should consider this when restoring a database from a backup, since the restored database is practically a new database.
