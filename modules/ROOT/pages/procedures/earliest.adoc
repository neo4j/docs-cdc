[[earliest]]
= Acquiring the earliest change id

The procedure `cdc.earliest` is used to acquire a change identifier for the earliest available change.

.Signature
[source]
----
cdc.earliest() :: (
    id :: STRING? // <1>
)
----

<1> A change identifier that refers to the earliest change available.

Unlike change identifiers returned from `cdc.query` or `cdc.current`, this identifier does not refer to a specific change.
Instead, it dynamically points to the earliest transaction log entry that contains change data capture information, up to the latest time when enrichment was enabled.
