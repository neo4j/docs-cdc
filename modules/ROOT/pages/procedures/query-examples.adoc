[NOTE]
====
The examples in this section assume that the parameter `$previousChangeId` is populated with a change identifier,
either from the result of a previous xref:procedures/index.adoc#query[query] or from using the xref:procedures/index.adoc#current[current] or xref:procedures/index.adoc#earliest[earliest] procedures.
====

== Selecting entities based on operation type
Changes can be filtered to only return creates, updates or deletes, regardless of whether the effected entity is a node or a relationship.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "e",
    operation: "c"
}])
----

== Selecting entities based on changed properties
Changes can be filtered to only include those where a certain property or properties are changed.
Note that if a list of properties is provided, for the change to be selected, all of the provided properties need to be changed in the same change event.

.Query entities where a specific property is changed
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "e",
    changesTo: ["name"]
}])
----

.Query nodes where a specific property is changed
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "n",
    changesTo: ["name"]
}])
----

.Query relationships where a specific property is changed
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "r",
    changesTo: ["registerId"]
}])
----

== Selecting entities based on change metadata
Changes can be filtered to only include those where the transaction was carried out by a particular user or certain metadata property or properties have been associated with that transaction.

.Query entities changed by a particular user
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "e",
    executingUser: "alice"
}])
----

.Query nodes changed by a user impersonating another
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "n",
    authenticatedUser: "alice",
    executingUser: "bob"
}])
----

.Query relationships changed when a specific metadata property was set on the transaction
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "r",
    txMetadata: {
        correlationId: 123456789
    }
}])
----

== Selecting nodes/relationships by element id
Changes can be filtered to a specific element id.
This might be useful when you are interested in changes made to a specific node or relationship.
See link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/functions/scalar/#functions-elementid[Cypher Manual -> Functions -> Scalar functions] for more information on getting element ids of existing entities.

.Query node changes
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "n",
    elementId: "4:e239be76-c7e8-43d8-aa03-567de592f426:0"
}])
----

.Query relationship changes
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "r",
    elementId: "5:a439fca3-d8b3-35f0-aa49-987fa112f993:0"
}])
----

== Selecting entities by key
Node changes can be filtered to match specified key properties.
The provided key properties need to fully match to a corresponding node key or relationship key on the entity.
See xref:procedures/elementids-key-properties.adoc[] for details.

.Query node changes by key
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "n",
    key: {
        name: "Kevin",
        surname: "Bacon"
    }
}])
----

.Query relationship changes by key
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "r",
    key: {
        registerId: 1001
    }
}])
----

[NOTE]
====
If the related constraints are added after a change on an entity is captured, the previous change events are not updated retroactively and do not match key selectors.
====

== Selecting nodes by label
Node changes can be filtered to specific labels.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "n",
    labels: ["Person", "Actor"]
}])
----

[NOTE]
====
The query above only returns changes on nodes that have *both* labels either before or after the change.
In order to get changes on nodes with either label, two separate selectors have to be specified.
See xref:procedures/selectors.adoc#combining-selectors[combining selectors] for details.
====

== Selecting relationships by type
Relationship changes can be filtered to a specific type.

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "r",
    type: "ACTED_IN"
}])
----

== Selecting relationships by start/end nodes
Relationship changes can be selected based on their start and end nodes.

.Query relationships that has a start node with a specific label
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "r",
    start: {
        labels: ["Person"]
    }
}])
----

.Query relationships that is between specific labels
[source, cypher, role="nocollapse"]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "r",
    start: {
        labels: ["Person"]
    },
    end: {
        labels: ["Movie"]
    }
}])
----

.Query relationships that is between specific labels and with a specific type
[source, cypher, role="nocollapse"]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "r",
    type: "ACTED_IN",
    start: {
        labels: ["Person"]
    },
    end: {
        labels: ["Movie"]
    }
}])
----

.Query relationships that involves a specific node
[source, cypher, role="nocollapse"]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "r",
    start: {
        labels: ["Person"],
        key: {
            name: "john",
            surname: "doe"
        }
    }
}, {
    select: "r",
    end: {
        labels: ["Person"],
        key: {
            name: "john",
            surname: "doe"
        }
    }
}])
----

.Query nodes and relationships of specific labels and types
[source, cypher, role="nocollapse"]
----
CALL db.cdc.query($previousChangeId, [{
    select: "n",
    labels: ["Person"]
}, {
    select: "n",
    labels: ["Movie"]
}, {
    select: "r",
    type: "ACTED_IN",
    start: {
