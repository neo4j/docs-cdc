= Constraints and the key field

Constraints are required for populating the `event.key` field on node changes and `event.start/end.keys` fields on relationship changes. With the following constraint, properties `name` and `lastname` will be present in the fields for all changes involving `PERSON` nodes:
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS FOR (n:PERSON) REQUIRE (n.name, n.lastname) IS NODE KEY
----
Alternatively, the key constraint can be split up into existence and uniqueness constraints.
[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS FOR (n:PERSON) REQUIRE n.name IS NOT NULL
CREATE CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS FOR (n:PERSON) REQUIRE n.lastname IS NOT NULL
CREATE CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS FOR (n:PERSON) REQUIRE (n.name, n.lastname) IS UNIQUE
----
