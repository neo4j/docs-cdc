:description: This chapter describes how to filter captured change data.

`cdc.unfiltered.query` procedure support filtering returned changes using user provided selectors.

== Selector schema

Full schema for selectors is defined below.
Each selector can contain a number of supported filters, where each filter needs to be satisfied by the change event to be included in the output.

=== Selecting entities

You can construct selectors that can both match nodes and relationships.

[source, json]
----
{
  "select": "e", // <1>
  "operation": "c", // <2>
  "changesTo": ["name", "title"] // <3>
}
----
All fields except for `select` are optional.

<1> Select changes on all entities.
Other valid values are `"n"` for nodes and `"r"` for relationships.
<2> Select changes which are creating entities.
Other valid values are `"u"` for entity updates and `"d"` for entity deletions.
<3> Select changes which affected all of the provided properties.

=== Selecting nodes

You can construct selectors that can only match nodes.

[source, json]
----
{
  "select": "n", // <1>
  "elementId": "4:b7e35973-0aff-42fa-873b-5de31868cb4a:1", // <2>
  "key": { // <3>
    "property": "value",
    "otherProperty": "value"
  },
  "labels": ["Person", "Actor"], // <4>
  "operation": "c", // <5>
  "changesTo": ["name", "lastName"] // <6>
}
----
All fields except for `select` are optional.

<1> Select changes on nodes.
Other valid values are `"e"` for all entities and `"r"` for relationships.
<2> Select changes on the node with this element id.
See link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/functions/scalar/#functions-elementid[Cypher Manual -> Functions -> Scalar functions] for more information on element ids.
<3> Select changes on nodes with matching key properties.
Key matching is only possible when specific constraints are defined on the node, see xref:getting-started/constraints.adoc[] for details.
<4> Select changes on nodes which have _all_ of the specified labels.
<5> Select changes which are creating nodes.
Other valid values are `"u"` for node updates and `"d"` for node deletions.
<6> Select changes which affect _all_ of the specified properties.

=== Selecting relationships

You can construct selectors that can only match relationships.

[source, json, role="nocollapse"]
----
{
  "select": "r", // <1>
  "elementId": "4:b7e35973-0aff-42fa-873b-5de31868cb4a:1", // <2>
  "type": "ACTED_IN", // <3>
  "key": { // <4>
    "property": "value",
    "otherProperty": "value"
  }, 
  "start": { // <5>
    "select": "n", // <6>
    "elementId": "4:b7e35973-0aff-42fa-873b-5de31868cb4a:1", // <7>
    "key": { // <8>
      "userId": "1001",
      "name": "John"
    },
    "labels": ["Person", "Actor"] // <9>
  },
  "end":{ // <10>
    "select": "n",
    "elementId": "5:b7e35973-0aff-42fa-873b-5de31878ab4a:3",
    "key": {
      "title": "Matrix"
    },
    "labels": ["Movie"]
  },
  "operation": "c", // <11>
  "changesTo": ["name", "lastName"] // <12>
}
----
All fields except for `select` are optional.

<1> Select changes on relationships.
Other valid values are `"e"` for all entities and `"n"` for nodes.
<2> Select changes on the relationship with this element id.
See link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/functions/scalar/#functions-elementid[Cypher Manual -> Functions -> Scalar functions] for more information on element ids.
<3> Select changes on relationships with this type.
<4> Select changes on relationships with matching key properties.
Key matching is only possible when specific constraints are defined on the relationship, see xref:getting-started/constraints.adoc[] for details.
<5> Select changes on relationships with a start node matching this node selector.
Note that `operation` and `changesTo` are not valid inside these node selectors.
<6> Optionally specify that this is a node selector.
Specifying `"r"` or `"e"` here will cause an error.
<7> Select relationships where the start node has this element id.
See link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/cypher-manual/{page-version}/functions/scalar/#functions-elementid[Cypher Manual -> Functions -> Scalar functions] for more information on element ids.
<8> Select relationships where the start node has these key properties.
Key matching is only possible when specific constraints are defined on the node, see xref:getting-started/constraints.adoc[] for details.
<9> Select relationships where the start node has these labels.
<10> Select relationships with end nodes matching this node selector.
Same schema as `start`.
<11> Select changes which are creating relationships.
Other valid values are `"u"` for relationship updates and `"d"` for relationship deletions.
<12> Select changes where all specified properties are affected.

[NOTE]
====
The relationship start and end node selectors mostly satisfy the regular node selector schema.
The only exception is that you cannot specify `operation` and `changesTo` fields inside relationship start and end node selectors.
====

== Metadata selectors

All of the above selectors also support matching based on the metadata associated with a change.

[source, json]
----
{
  "select": "e", // <1>
  "authenticatedUser": "alice", // <2>
  "executingUser": "bob", // <3>
  "txMetadata": { // <4>
    "property": "value",
    "otherProperty": 42
  },
  //...
}
----
All fields except for `select` are optional.

<1> May also be applied to 'n' and 'r' selectors.
<2> Select changes where the authenticated user matches the value provided.
<3> Select changes where the executing user matches the value provided.
<4> Select changes where the transactional metadata key/values match the provided entries.

[[combining-selectors]]
== Combining selectors

The more specific a selector is, the fewer changes are returned.
For example, specifying both `name` and `surname` as a `changesTo` value only returns changes where both `name` *and* `surname` properties have changed within the same transaction.

.Query changes updating both `name` and `surname` properties
[source, cypher]
----
CALL cdc.unfiltered.query($previousChangeId, [{select:"n", changesTo:["name", "surname"]}])
----

In order to extract changes for either `name` *or* `surname` properties, two separate selectors have to be specified:

.Query changes updating either `name` or `surname` properties
[source, cypher]
----
CALL cdc.unfiltered.query($previousChangeId, [
    {select:"n", changesTo:["name"]},
    {select:"n", changesTo:["surname"]}
])
----
