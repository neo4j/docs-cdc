CALL cdc.query(selectors=[
    {
        select: "e",

        executingUser: "bob",

The CDC query procedure `cdc.query` can now use metadata selectors for each of the entity selection types (e,n,r). The 3 options available are:

 - txMetadata: key/value pairs to match on
 - executingUser: the user that executed the transaction
 - authenticatedUser: the authenticated user that executed the transaction (may be different to executingUser when performing user impersonation)
