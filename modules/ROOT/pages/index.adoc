= Introduction

====
TODO general introduction, what is CDC?
====
====
TODO examples are similar to the movie graph, but not actually following the movie graph. See if northwind is complicated enough or if we should go with our own.

====
*TODO put these topics/stuff somewhere:*
- what is seq
* change order within tx (create node, create rel, update node update rel etc???)
//         final var expected = List.of(
//                new EventInfo(Type.NODE, Operation.CREATE, idMapper.nodeElementId(nodeToAdd), false),
//                new EventInfo(Type.RELATIONSHIP, Operation.CREATE, idMapper.relationshipElementId(relToAdd), false),
//                new EventInfo(Type.NODE, Operation.UPDATE, nodeLabelModify, false),
//                new EventInfo(Type.NODE, Operation.UPDATE, nodePropModify, false),
//                new EventInfo(Type.RELATIONSHIP, Operation.UPDATE, relPropModify, false),
//                new EventInfo(Type.NODE, Operation.DELETE, nodeToDelete, false),
//                new EventInfo(Type.RELATIONSHIP, Operation.DELETE, relToDelete, true));
- For create events `event.state.before` is null
- For delete events `event.state.after` is null
- For update events neither is null, they might be empty maps for diff mode


*Scenarios?*

- Start/Stop database
- Leader switch
- Enable/Disable/Change enrichment mode
* DIFF -> FULL -> DIFF is silent, but causes different output?

*TODO finishing touches:*

- Make sure links work and make sense (don't put a link from one section to the one right below...)
- double check "earliest" syntax in examples, is "0" always valid as "earliest"
- Delete this TODO list...
