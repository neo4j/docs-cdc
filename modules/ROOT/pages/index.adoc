= Introduction

====
TODO general introduction, what is CDC?
====
====
TODO examples are similar to the movie graph, but not actually following the movie graph. See if northwind is complicated enough or if we should go with our own.
====

====
*TODO put these topics/stuff somewhere:*

- For create events `event.state.before` is null
- For delete events `event.state.after` is null
- For update events neither is null, they might be empty maps for diff mode

*Current docs todos*



- example cdc application
- add return values to applicable cypher statements, such as: https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/manage-databases/queries/#manage-databases-queries-show-database



*Scenarios?*

- Start/Stop database
- Leader switch
- Enable/Disable/Change enrichment mode
* DIFF -> FULL -> DIFF is silent, but causes different output?

*TODO finishing touches:*

- Make sure links work and make sense (don't put a link from one section to the one right below...)
- double check "earliest" syntax in examples, is "0" always valid as "earliest"
- Delete this TODO list...
