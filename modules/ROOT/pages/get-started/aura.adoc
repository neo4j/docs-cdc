= CDC on Aura instances (cloud)

include::partial$get-started.adoc[tags=intro]


[[toggle-cdc-mode]]
== Enable/Toggle CDC mode

Admin users can tweak the CDC mode for a database through the setting  *Edit CDC Mode*, accessible via the Aura instance options.
Non-admin users may view the current CDC mode, but may not edit it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Modifying CDC mode from `DIFF` to `FULL` or vice-versa immediately changes the  xref:procedures/output-schema.adoc[structure of captured changes].
Your CDC application must be able to deal with the change of format.
====


[[disable-cdc]]
== Disable CDC

To disable CDC on a database, access the instance options through the three dots on the instance card, select *Edit CDC Mode*, and set it to `OFF`.
Only admin users can tweak the CDC mode.

[WARNING]
====
Disabling CDC immediately breaks the continuity of change events.
**Change identifiers generated before disabling can no longer be used and, even if CDC is re-enabled, the previously-generated change identifiers remain invalid.**
Disabling and then re-enabling CDC is equivalent to enabling it for the first time: there is no memory of previous changes.
====

*CDC is automatically disabled for:*

* New instances
* Cloned instances
* Paused instances
* Instances restored from a snapshot


[[key-considerations]]
== Key considerations


[[pause-resume]]
=== Paused/Resumed databases
Although it is possible to pause a database that has CDC mode set to `DIFF` or `FULL`, **the CDC mode gets set to `OFF` when the database is resumed**.

When an instance is resumed, it behaves similarly to https://neo4j.com/docs/cdc/current/backup-restore/[restoring a snapshot].

[[log-retention]]
=== Transaction log retention

Since CDC information is stored in transaction log entries, the time for which the logs are retained dictates how much back in time your application may query for CDC data.

As new transactions come in, the server writes them to a log file. When that file exceeds 256MB, it creates a new file and continues writing there (transactions are never broken across files though, so if the current log is 255MB when a new 5MB transaction comes in, the file will grow to 260MB before rotating to a new file).

Every 15 minutes _or_ 100000 transactions (whichever happens first), the server goes through the transaction log files from newer to oldest.
When the sum of the scanned files is greater than 2GB, all subsequent files are deleted, including the latest scanned one, so that the total size is again below 2GB.
Files older than 1 day are also deleted.

In other words, the server keeps _at most_ 2GB worth of transaction logs, as long as they are all more recent than 1 day.
Regarding size, the server keeps _at least_ `2GB - 256MB` worth of transaction logs (256MB are always needed for the current log file to grow into) -- some may however be deleted if they are older than 1 day.
In case large transactions made log files grow larger than 256MB, the minimum total retained size may be smaller than `2GB - 256MB`.
