= Using CDC with existing databases

You can enable log enrichment on existing databases in order to be able to track changes.
However, enabling log enrichment affects only future transactions and existing data will not be surfaced by CDC procedures.
If your use case requires a snapshot of existing data for CDC purposes, best practice is to;

* Enable log enrichment with one of the desired values
* Set database to read-only
* Capture current change identifier
* Perform a snapshot using an application of your own that reads all nodes and relationships of interest and process those according to your CDC requirements
* Set database to read-write
* Run your CDC application starting with the captured change identifier
